Code combat was very glitchy for me.  It froze while loading a bunch of times.  I tried on Windows 8.1 and OSX Mavericks, both in Chrome.  They need to optimize some code.  My MacBookPro was super hot and the fan was spinning at top speed.

On the third day I tried and succeeded (though I thought it still ran poorly).  However, by that time I forgot I need to copy my code.  I did it I promise.
 
Despite my issues, I hope they are able to optimize Code Combat because it is a well designed site and a really cool way to learn.
 
- What does the `()` do in JavaScript?
  () denotes a function.  Anything placed inside the () will be passed to the function, including strings, numbers and variables.
  
  - What is the point of the semicolons?
  Semicolons define lines of code.  Missing semicolons are such a common error, but part of many C descendant languages including JavaScript and PHP.  It seems logical for Ruby to define the line break as the end of a code line (in most cases).  However, there are instances in JavaScript, like defining a hash, where the semicolon allows the programmer to spread code over several lines for ease of reading.  Luckily, Ruby seems to have figured that out too.
