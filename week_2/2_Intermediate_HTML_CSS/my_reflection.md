# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
Great.  My old boss used to tell me that many times they would build a $15k+ site for a company and specify in the contract that the backend would only work in IE.  After they finished, the customer would ask why it didn't work in Netscape.  He would show the contract and explain that it would cost thousands of dollars to make it work in Netscape, or they could just tell their employees to use IE, which is free.  He was thrilled that IE won.

Fast forward to today and browser fragmentation is greater than ever.  5 major desktop browsers x variants for tablets and smartphones.  In the days of the desktop, IE was the Web Standards.  Thanks to all the different devices we use, one browser will not likely ever rule again.  We need web standards to save on wasted development costs and keep the web nimble.


* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
Yes.  One trade doesn't build a house.  Specialization of files makes them more efficient and allows developers/designers to specialize.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
I thought I knew HTML.  This blew my mind.  If I could make one change to HTML, this was it.  Its not about less code, its about making it easier to read.  The slight reduction in letters likely makes a negligible difference in speed.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

To ditch the standard formating which is, and looks, old.


* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

All of them.  I prefer Linux, but to use Adobe CC I need Windows or OSX.  This is how I feel about Opera.  Its cool, but with an Android phone in my pocket, my gmail account, and my buy-in to all the other Google services, I feel best supported in Chrome.


Browser rendering differences are much better than just a few years ago.  I think it is good that they are all almost the same now.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
