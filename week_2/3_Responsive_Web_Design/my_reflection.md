# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Design 1 site for all screens.  Responsive design reorganizes html elements according to screen ranges.  The designer can set 2 or more ranges (usually 3 or 4) to cover all possible devices.

It is a time saver as there is only 1 site code to maintain.  Additionally, it can hurt search listings if a company has a separate mobile site with a unique URL but identical content.

The big issue I have is that bootstrap is so popular everything is starting to look the same.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Early phones had slow internet and low resolutions.  For these reasons, mobile website could only have limited functions.  Today, internet speeds are fast and pixel densities are high.  Consumer expect all features available in all places.  It is part of the reason I am in DBC.

In the near future I see technology replacing many designers or sending their jobs overseas, but I think developer jobs will grow.  As far as how it will change the landscape of the web, I have seen enough to know not to guess.


* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

Screen readers and magnification.  Budgets and audience size will determine the extent to which sites cater to the disabled.  Just as a small business is exempt from some ADA laws because they can't afford to follow them, small sites have to spend their money on the largest group of potential customers.  Large sites with national or international appeal like Facebook should design for the visually impaired.

All designers should add alt text when applicable to help the visually impaired.  It is a minor, practically free technique.


* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Did Al Gore really invent this?


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
