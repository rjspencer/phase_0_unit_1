        <h2>Pairing Session 1</h2>
    </header>
    <div>
        <p>No one has a constant stream of thoughts.  By pairing, we can code faster, check eachothers work, and learn from the techniques of others</p>
        <p>Pairing also adds a social aspect to a traditionally 
        lonely pursuit.  
        </p>
        <p>The extra set of eyes helps prevent 
            traveling down rabbit holes.  Your partners can 
            help you realize when to stop and 
            find a different way.
        </p>

        <p>Having someone depending on you forces you
             to find a solution.  
        </p>
        <p>Senior programmers can pair with junior programmers 
            and a mentoring relationship develops.  Even peers 
            likely know something you don't know 
            and vice versa.  Pair programming is constantly improving the skills of all parties.

      <h3>Driver/Navigator Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigator can focus on code/direction instead of typing.</li>
          <li>Navigator can identify typos more easily.</li>
          <li>Driver can type faster when he doesn't have to focus on coming up with ideas.</li>
          <li>Both parties push each other push each other to work harder, better, faster, stronger.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>I like the comraderie that is pairing.  Sometimes I like to be alone, and I will continue to code alone, but I would be fine if the majority of my work was done in pairs.
