# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I have been interested in usability for a long time.  Long enough to call it usability.


* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I was already incorporating UX ideas into my work.  I made a comment to one of my accountability partners about how a non-solid background makes text difficult to read.

My wife is gettting mad cause I keep tinkering and making minor adjustments.  I made a graphical New Years Resolution and RWD is on it.  I can finally check that off.


* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I started with my code from last week.  I should have started fresh.  If I have time tomorrow, I will.  Modifying existing code seems to be as much work as starting fresh.  Plus, it makes it hard to be original when another design is staring you in the face.


* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

The collapsed article height should be based on line height so letters don't get cut off when it is collapsed.

I need to fire up Illustrator and make some cool graphics.  Maybe I can find time to learn to create HTML5 animation with Adobe Edge Animate.  I would like to add a picture viewer and add all my graphic design work.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

RWD is super cool and easier than I thought it would be.  

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
