# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

SCOPE.  How much should I do?  I'm trying to be the best at this that I can, so there is never too much learning, right?  I should add this, and that, and Google says I can reduce page load time by 3.4%, and...

* How will you combat that? 

Planning.   

* What techniques will you try?

I need to set a schedule for the week with a set number of hours.  If I run out of time, I keep working until I complete the minimum.  If I have extra time I can learn more and revisit section I want to learn more about.

I also need a plan of attack for each challenge.  I need to do a paper sketch of each site I build with a list of requirements,  I know I will make modifications as I go, but a plan will help me stay on task and within the scope of the project.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I will start each challenge with a plan. I will dedicate 4 hours x 4 days to each week during Phase 0. Additionally, I will take 4 personal days off work to dedicate to either catching up, enhancing skills I enjoy, or building an online presence in anticipation of the future job hunt.
