* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
I plotted out my website challenge on paper including a list of required elements, then planned my commits, and finally drew a rough sketch of the site layout.  I like that workflow.

The html came first including all the class and id markers.  I put basic titles or filler text in each tag.  Then I added the css.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
Adding a blank div with a clear:left to make sure the footer goes below the content, no matter how much there is.


* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
I am very confident that I can do, or easily find the answer to, most any HTML/CSS challenge.


* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
I enjoyed trying to create a modern look with minimal colors.  


* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I manually typed everything as a refresher.  I have worked with my own templates and bootstrap on my last few projects.
