* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 

Closing tags in the right place/order can be a bit like forgetting semicolons in php, but I understand their purpose.  

HTML is just basic structure.  I've always thought it to be a bit more complex than it needs to be.  I think HTML5 is shortening up a few tags, like linking stylesheets.  They weren't necessary in 1995 and its taken a while to simplify the tag of a virtually essential part of todays websites.

* What seems good and bad about HTML?

I like HTMLs simplicity in functionality.  That simplicity can cause some tags to be very complex.  Its a tradeoff.

It is amazing that HTML has lasted with little change for so long in such a fast changing field.


* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

More like oh, d'oh moments.  I'm trying to catch up and I inserted my images without including the "images" folder in the link, left out a chunk of the stylesheet call, and didn't understand why my page wouldn't load when I typed it in wrong.

I need to slow down a bit.

http://www.w3schools.com/  It is a simple reference with simple examples, but it is great when you know what you need to do but lack the right syntax to do it.
