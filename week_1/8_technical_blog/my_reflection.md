Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I think its easy to go through life not really paying much attention to design.  But, design influences the clothes we wear, the music we listen to, menu design can lead us to order more expensive food, and design can even change the way we feel about a person.  Luckily, I had Professor Daubek for Marketing in college and he challenged us to see design and how it affects our lives.

So, yes, I kind of geek out on this kind of thing.

Even as someone that thinks about these things, I found the wireframe exercise very useful.  I easily noticed things that I hadn't paid attention to before.
