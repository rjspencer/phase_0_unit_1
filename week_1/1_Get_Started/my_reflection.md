* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
 
I have been interested in web development for a while now, so I had heard of git a while ago.  Before I applied to DBC, I started on Michael Hartl's rails tutorial to make sure I could do it.  I already had a Github account and have learned to make branches and commits with bash.  What I did not know was that I could edit right on Github, nor how to use the desktop app.  

When I started with git, it was pretty confusing until I found the right analogy: manual Dropbox.


* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 

Imagine that under the hood Dropbox and Google Drive used the same software.  Github would be Dropbox/Drive and the software would be git.  However, git is a more technical version, like driving a stick shift car.  The driver has to choose when and how to sync files.  Git offers more power/features but is harder to use.


* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.

Version control is the process of managing the step by step building, maintaining, and improving process of anything with words like code, poetry, or books (but usually code).  Version control allows multiple people to work on sections of the final product at the same time and bring their revisions together.  Contributors can experiment on part of the project in a separate branch and then decide whether to dump their changes or add them back to the master.

Github is simply a unified repository for all changes/revisions/branches that all contributors can utilize.  


* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

SO many reasons.  I buy into the idea of version control.

In an emergency (heartbleed), many contributors can separately branch the same code and try many solutions concurrently.  If someone finds a valid solution, it can quickly be merged into the main code.

If a coder spends several hours trying to add a feature to their site and they hate what they have made, they can just trash it.  Without version control they would waste tons of time finding every line they changed.

If a new site feature goes live, and then after real world use a major bug is discovered, developers can use git to quickly roll back to the last working version.

All changes have a date/time and user attached adding accountability to the development process.


* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I don't understand why a poet or writer would use git.  Automatic services like Dropbox or Google Drive (especially with its collab features) would seem to be a better fit for most.

I'm not sure why there is a desktop app.  When a rails coder is working, they already need a text editor, terminal, and web browser open.  Two of those can access Github, why have another program open?

I love collaboration tools like Drive, so the concept seems pretty logical to me.
