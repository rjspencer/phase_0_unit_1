* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
Creating a new repository is simple on Github.  Think of it as a master folder to hold all the files and folders for a single project.  

Login to GitHub and select your "Repositories" tab.  Click the green new button to create a new repo.  Add a unique name, description, and license for your project.  Simply click the green "Create Repository" button and you are done.


* Describe what open source means
Software can be distributed in binary or source format.  Most software is distributed in binary format, zeroes and ones.  Binary is essentially software you cannot edit.  Programmers do not write binary.  They create source code.

In order to see how a program works, you need to see the source code.  Open source does not mean free.  It means the creators have choosen to allow you to see the way it works.  In many situations, the licensing allows you to use, modify, and redistribute the software.


* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I'm a strong capitalist and the open source movement has always puzzled me.  I have used a ton of open source programs including Inkscape, Gimp, Zen Cart, Wordpress, and Linux.  Add into that all the programs that have open source part such as Chrome and OSX, and nearly every piece of software I touch has a bit of Communism in it.

I don't understand the idea of working my butt off and giving it away.  This has puzzled me for years.  

However, I think I finally understand.  I'm an analogy guy.  The world of freemium services like Evernote and free games with in-app purchases that fill our smartphones have allowed me to understand that developers can use open source projects to market their paid-for developer services.


* Assess the importance of using licenses

Creatives deserve credit for their work.  Whether they chose to give away that work is up to them.  Licenses protect and normalize that process.


* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I'm trying to use terminal as much as possible to get ahead of the game where I can.  This helped reinforce those skills.  I had to look up mkdir.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

simplynoise.com + musicforprogramming.net at the same time helps me shut the world out.
