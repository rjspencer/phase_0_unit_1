* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I like the reading about Design Thinking.  I think too many people believe planning is either the Scientific Method or nothing.  Science deals in absolutes.  The real world does not.  Design Thinking embraces planning while leaving room for constant course adjustments.  Invention has always been a process of building on that which came before.  Smartphones could not have been invented without the microprocessor could not have been invented without electricity could not have been invented with metalurgy.....

I'm a bit of a design freak.  I'm not terrible good at it myself, but I know what looks good and keep up on trends.  I constantly evaluate things I see and ponder why they are or are not effective.

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  

Why is Sublime not that great for HTML?  Brackets.io / Adobe Edge Code is better.  I keep switching back.  I wonder if it can handle Ruby?  I wonder if you noticed you spelled CHALLENGE wrong?  I wonder if I can figure out how to fork and push a change?

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  

I'm pretty comfortable here.  I think I'm doing too much.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I challenged myself to add a expanding/contracting div for my posts with jQuery.  I won.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 

9/10

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I liked drawing the wireframes.  I am very comfortable in Illustrator and I think it is way better for site mockups than Photoshop.  However, I am such a nerd and a few years ago realized that I really too much on tech.  Planning should start on paper.  Only after confidence in the design do I move to the computer.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I do to much and make myself feel rushed so reading can be tedious.  Plus, I've always found tech reading a bit tedious.
